# June 20th: Gettin started with research

The first thing was asking a nerd friend who could give me some pointers how to get started on this project. This is my first custom project and I literally have no experience with electronics except making a MacroPad with a guide at hand. So the first thing I asked him was what parts I will be needing and he told me to do some research first on what features I will be needing for the planter. I moved on looking at some other commercial smart planter and this one is really cool called Ivy, it has temperature, soil moisture, ambient light, water level, touch and vibration?!? sensors. But as a noob I decided to keep it simple and cheap. so after some brainstorming I’m going with temperature, soil moisture, light, and motion sensors.

The parts that I’ve looked into are:

- [XIAO ESP32 S3](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007084388623.html)
- [OLED RGB display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004794240558.html)
- [LIPO Battery 3.7V 1500mAH 103048](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008218024646.html)
- [SHT30 Temperature And Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5064)
- [Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor - I2C Capacitive Moisture Sensor - JST PH 2mm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026)
- [Adafruit BH1750 Light Sensor - STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4681)

**Estimated Costs (USD):**

- XIAO ESP32 S3: $6.90
- OLED RGB display: $10.10
- LIPO Battery 3.7V 1500mAH 103048: $4.70
- SHT30 Temperature And Humidity Sensor: $8.95
- Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor: $7.50
- Adafruit BH1750 Light Sensor: $4.50

**Total time spent: 4h**
